## Note on FINDIC and REST Countries

The `ChileDataAPI` package depends on two public RESTful APIs for accessing Chilean and global data:

1. **FINDIC**
A public Chilean API that provides programmatic access to official financial and economic indicators of Chile.
It allows querying time series of various indicators such as the observed dollar exchange rate, inflation (CPI), interest rates, stock market values, and more.
The project's goal is to facilitate fast and reliable access to key economic data of the country, encouraging its use in financial analysis, academic research, and educational applications.
The API delivers up-to-date data directly from official sources such as the Central Bank of Chile and other relevant institutions.
Website: [https://findic.cl](https://findic.cl)
Terms of Use: The API is publicly accessible, does not require authentication, and is intended for educational, analytical, and experimental purposes.


2. **REST Countries API**  
   An open-source project that offers information about countries worldwide, including demographics, geography, and regional groupings.  
   This API is also publicly accessible and does not require authentication.  
   Website: [https://restcountries.com/](https://restcountries.com/)

As per the maintainers of both APIs, **no attribution is required** for using or distributing the data.  
However, we recommend reviewing the official documentation and usage terms on their respective websites to ensure proper understanding and responsible use.
