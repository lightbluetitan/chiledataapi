# ChileDataAPI

The `ChileDataAPI` package provides a unified interface to access open data from the *FINDIC API* and the *REST Countries API*, with a focus on Chile. 
It allows users to easily retrieve up-to-date time series data on financial indicators such as the **UF, UTM, Dollar, Euro, Yen, Copper price per pound, Bitcoin, and the IPSA index**, as well as international metadata on countries via standardized API calls.

All API-based functions return data as tidy tibble objects, making them ready for immediate use in data pipelines.
The financial indicator functions, such as `get_chile_dollar()`, `get_chile_uf()`, and `get_chile_bitcoin()`, provide real-time series of daily or monthly values, with each row representing a timestamped observation. 
This makes `ChileDataAPI` a valuable tool for working with economic time series data in a reproducible manner.

```R

install.packages("ChileDataAPI")

```
