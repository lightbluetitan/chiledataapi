#' Human Rights Abuses in the Pinochet Regime (1973â€“1990)
#'
#' This dataset, pinochet_regime_df, is a data frame containing detailed information about human rights violations
#' that occurred in Chile during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, spanning from 1973 to 1990.
#' The data includes victim-level records such as names, age, gender, affiliation, nature of the violence,
#' methods used, and geographic information when available. It is based on the National Truth and Reconciliation
#' Commission Report (1991, ISBN:9780268016463). The dataset also includes georeferenced locations across
#' multiple levels for incidents where such data could be retrieved.
#'
#' The dataset name has been kept as pinochet_regime_df to avoid confusion with other datasets
#' in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
#' ChileDataAPI package and assists users in identifying its specific characteristics.
