\description{
This dataset, malleco_tree_rings_ts, is a time series object (`ts`) containing the average annual tree ring width,
measured in millimeters, for Araucaria Araucana trees located in the Malleco region of Chile.
The data spans 734 years, from 1242 to 1975, and was originally collected for use in climate and environmental
reconstructions. The frequency of the series is annual (one observation per year). The series shows interannual
variability in growth and is suitable for time series analysis and dendrochronological studies.

\details{
The dataset name has been kept as 'malleco_tree_rings_ts' to avoid confusion with other datasets
in the R ecosystem. This naming convention helps distinguish this dataset as part of the
ChileDataAPI package and assists users in identifying its specific characteristics.
The suffix 'ts' indicates that the dataset is a time series object. The original content has not been modified
in any way.
